## **2.5** Water
- Structure and interactions:
    - **Polar molecule:** overall charge is unevenly distributed
    - **Hydrogen bonding:** the slightly positive hydrogen of one molecule is attracted to the slightly negative oxygen of a nearby molecule. Bonds form and break quickly in liquid water.
    - Four emergent properties arise

#### 1. Cohesive behavior:
- **Cohesion:** hydrogen bonds keep water molecules close together
- **Adhesion:** water clings to other substances through hydrogen bonds
- Cohesion gives water an unusually high **surface tension**

#### 2. Moderation of temperature:
- Water absorbs heat from warm air and releases heat to cooler air
- Effective as a heat bank due to its high specific heat
- **Thermal energy:** kinetic energy associated with random movement of atoms or molecules  
    **Temperature:** average kinetic energy of the molecules  
    **Heat:** thermal energy in transfer between bodies of matter  
    **Calorie:** amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 1&deg;C  
    **Joule:** another unit of energy, one calorie equals 4.184 J
- **Specific heat:** amount of heat needed for 1 g of a substance to change its temperature by 1&deg;C
    - 1 cal/g$\cdot$&deg;C for water
    - Water resists changing its temperature because much of the heat is first used to disrupt hydrogen bonds. When the temperature drops, newly formed hydrogen bonds release heat.
    - Can moderate temperatures near and in large bodies of water
- **Evaporative cooling:** as a liquid evaporates, the surface of the liquid cools down
    - **Heat of vaporization:** the quantity of heat a liquid must absorb for 1 g of it to be converted to gas
    - Water also has a high heat of vaporization, hydrogen bonds must be broken
    - Contributes to the stability of temperature in bodies of water and prevents organisms from overheating

#### 3. Floating of ice on liquid water:
- As liquid water freezes, it expands:
    - As the temperature falls, molecules move too slowly to break hydrogen bonds
    - The bonds lock molecules in a crystalline lattice and hold the molecules apart, becoming less dense
- Floating ice insulates the liquid water below, preventing it from freezing and allowing life to exist

#### 4. Versatility as a solvent:
- **Solution:** a liquid that is a homogenous mixture of two or more substances  
    **Solvent:** the dissolving agent  
    **Solute:** the substance that is dissolved  
    **Aqueous solution:** a solution with water as the solvent
- **Hydration shell:** the sphere of water molecules around dissolved ions or polar molecules, separating and shielding them from one another
    - The charged regions of water molecules are attracted to the charged ions
    - Molecules of water surround polar solutes by forming hydrogen bonds
- **Hydrophilic:** any substance that has a high affinity for water, does not necessarily have to dissolve  
    **Hydrophobic:** substances with no affinity for water, nonionic or nonpolar
- Solute concentration in aqueous solutions:
    - **Molecular mass:** the sum of the masses of all the atoms in a molecule
    - **Mole:** represents an exact number of objects. 6.02 $\times$ 10^23^, Avogadro's number.
    - **Molarity:** the number of moles of solute per liter of solution

#### Acids and bases:
- A hydrogen atom participating in a hydrogen bond may occasionally shift from one molecule to the other:
    - A **hydrogen ion** (H^+^) is transferred
    - **Hydroxide ion** (OH^-^)**:** water molecule that loses a proton
    - **Hydronium ion** (H~3~O^+^)**:** water molecule that gains a proton, conventionally represented by H^+^
- **Acid:** a substance that increases the hydrogen ion concentration  
    **Base:** a substance that reduces the hydrogen ion concentration, either by accepting hydrogen ions directly or by dissociating into hydroxide ions and forming water
- Strong acids/bases dissociate completely, while weak acids/bases reversibly release and accept ions
- **pH:** log scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration. Values less than 7 are acidic, above 7 is basic.
- **Buffer:** a substance that minimizes changes in the concentrations of H^+^ and OH^-^. Donates hydrogen ions when they are depleted and accepts ions when they are in excess.
