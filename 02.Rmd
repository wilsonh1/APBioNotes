# **2** The Chemical Context of Life {#chem}

## **2.1-4** chem lol

## **2.5** Water
- Structure and interactions:
    - **Polar molecule:** overall charge is unevenly distributed
    - **Hydrogen bonding:** the slightly positive hydrogen of one molecule is attracted to the slightly negative oxygen of a nearby molecule. Bonds form and break quickly in liquid water.
    - Four emergent properties arise

#### **1.** Cohesive behavior
- Hydrogen bonds keep water molecules close together (**cohesion**)
- Hydrogen bonds result in the clinging of water to other substances (**adhesion**)
- Cohesion gives water an unusually high **surface tension**

#### **2.** Moderation of temperature:
- Water absorbs heat from warm air and releases heat to cooler behavior
- Effective as a heat bank due to its high **specific heat**
