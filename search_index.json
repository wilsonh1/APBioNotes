Bonds form and break quickly in liquid water. Four emergent properties arise 1.2.0.1 1. Cohesive behavior: Cohesion: hydrogen bonds keep water molecules close together Adhesion: water clings to other substances through hydrogen bonds Cohesion gives water an unusually high surface tension 1.2.0.2 2. Moderation of temperature: Water absorbs heat from warm air and releases heat to cooler air Effective as a heat bank due to its high specific heat Thermal energy: kinetic energy associated with random movement of atoms or molecules Temperature: average kinetic energy of the molecules Heat: thermal energy in transfer between bodies of matter Calorie: amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 1°C Joule: another unit of energy, one calorie equals 4.184 J Specific heat: amount of heat needed for 1 g of a substance to change its temperature by 1°C 1 cal/g\\(\\cdot\\)°C for water Water resists changing its temperature because much of the heat is first used to disrupt hydrogen bonds. When the temperature drops, newly formed hydrogen bonds release heat. Can moderate temperatures near and in large bodies of water Evaporative cooling: as a liquid evaporates, the surface of the liquid cools down Heat of vaporization: the quantity of heat a liquid must absorb for 1 g of it to be converted to gas Water also has a high heat of vaporization, hydrogen bonds must be broken Contributes to the stability of temperature in bodies of water and prevents organisms from overheating 1.2.0.3 3. Floating of ice on liquid water: As liquid water freezes, it expands: As the temperature falls, molecules move too slowly to break hydrogen bonds The bonds lock molecules in a crystalline lattice and hold the molecules apart, becoming less dense Floating ice insulates the liquid water below, preventing it from freezing and allowing life to exist 1.2.0.4 4. Versatility as a solvent: Solution: a liquid that is a homogenous mixture of two or more substances Solvent: the dissolving agent Solute: the substance that is dissolved Aqueous solution: a solution with water as the solvent Hydration shell: the sphere of water molecules around dissolved ions or polar molecules, separating and shielding them from one another The charged regions of water molecules are attracted to the charged ions Molecules of water surround polar solutes by forming hydrogen bonds Hydrophilic: any substance that has a high affinity for water, does not necessarily have to dissolve Hydrophobic: substances with no affinity for water, nonionic or nonpolar Solute concentration in aqueous solutions: Molecular mass: the sum of the masses of all the atoms in a molecule Mole: an exact number of objects. 6.02 \\(\\times\\) 1023, Avogadro’s number. Molarity: the number of moles of solute per liter of solution 1.2.0.5 Acids and bases: A hydrogen atom participating in a hydrogen bond may occasionally shift from one molecule to the other: A hydrogen ion (H+) is transferred Hydroxide ion (OH-): water molecule that lost a proton Hydronium ion (H3O+): water molecule that gains a proton, conventionally represented by H+ Acid: a substance that increases the hydrogen ion concentration Base: a substance that reduces the hydrogen ion concentration, either by accepting hydrogen ions directly or by dissociating into hydroxide ions and forming water Strong acids/bases dissociate completely, while weak acids/bases reversibly release and accept ions pH: log scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration. Values less than 7 are acidic, above 7 is basic. Buffer: a substance that minimizes changes in the concentrations of H+ and OH-. Donates hydrogen ions when they are depleted and accepts ions when they are in excess. "],

Bilayer arrangement shelters the hydrophobic tails while exposing the hydrophilic heads to water. Most membrane proteins are also amphipathic: Can reside in the phospholipid bilayer with hydrophilic regions protruding Provide its hydrophobic parts with a nonaqueous environment "]
