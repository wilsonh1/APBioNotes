Bonds form and break quickly in liquid water. Four emergent properties arise 1.2.0.1 1. Cohesive behavior: Cohesion: hydrogen bonds keep water molecules close together Adhesion: water clings to other substances through hydrogen bonds Cohesion gives water an unusually high surface tension 1.2.0.2 2. Moderation of temperature: Water absorbs heat from warm air and releases heat to cooler air Effective as a heat bank due to its high specific heat Thermal energy: kinetic energy associated with random movement of atoms or molecules Temperature: average kinetic energy of the molecules Heat: thermal energy in transfer between bodies of matter Calorie: amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 1°C Joule: another unit of energy, one calorie equals 4.184 J Specific heat: amount of heat needed for 1 g of a substance to change its temperature by 1°C 1 cal/g\\(\\cdot\\)°C for water Water resists changing its temperature because much of the heat is first used to disrupt hydrogen bonds. When the temperature drops, newly formed hydrogen bonds release heat. Can moderate temperatures near and in large bodies of water Evaporative cooling: as a liquid evaporates, the surface of the liquid cools down Heat of vaporization: the quantity of heat a liquid must absorb for 1 g of it to be converted to gas Water also has a high heat of vaporization, hydrogen bonds must be broken Contributes to the stability of temperature in bodies of water and prevents organisms from overheating 1.2.0.3 3. Floating of ice on liquid water: As liquid water freezes, it expands: As the temperature falls, molecules move too slowly to break hydrogen bonds The bonds lock molecules in a crystalline lattice and hold the molecules apart, becoming less dense Floating ice insulates the liquid water below, preventing it from freezing and allowing life to exist 1.2.0.4 4. Versatility as a solvent: Solution: a liquid that is a homogenous mixture of two or more substances Solvent: the dissolving agent Solute: the substance that is dissolved Aqueous solution: a solution with water as the solvent Hydration shell: the sphere of water molecules around dissolved ions or polar molecules, separating and shielding them from one another The charged regions of water molecules are attracted to the charged ions Molecules of water surround polar solutes by forming hydrogen bonds Hydrophilic: any substance that has a high affinity for water, does not necessarily have to dissolve Hydrophobic: substances with no affinity for water, nonionic or nonpolar Solute concentration in aqueous solutions: Molecular mass: the sum of the masses of all the atoms in a molecule Mole: represents an exact number of objects. 6.02 \\(\\times\\) 1023, Avogadro’s number. Molarity: the number of moles of solute per liter of solution 1.2.0.5 Acids and bases: A hydrogen atom participating in a hydrogen bond may occasionally shift from one molecule to the other: A hydrogen ion (H+) is transferred Hydroxide ion (OH-): water molecule that loses a proton Hydronium ion (H3O+): water molecule that gains a proton, conventionally represented by H+ Acid: a substance that increases the hydrogen ion concentration Base: a substance that reduces the hydrogen ion concentration, either by accepting hydrogen ions directly or by dissociating into hydroxide ions and forming water Strong acids/bases dissociate completely, while weak acids/bases reversibly release and accept ions pH: log scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration. Values less than 7 are acidic, above 7 is basic. Buffer: a substance that minimizes changes in the concentrations of H+ and OH-. Donates hydrogen ions when they are depleted and accepts ions when they are in excess. "],

Bilayer arrangement shelters the hydrophobic tails while exposing the hydrophilic heads to water. Most membrane proteins are also amphipathic: Can reside in the phospholipid bilayer with hydrophilic regions protruding Provides its hydrophobic parts with a nonaqueous environment Fluid mosaic model: the membrane is a mosaic of protein molecules bobbing in a fluid phospholipid bilayer 3.1.0.1 The fluidity of membranes: Most lipids and some proteins can shift about laterally: Proteins are much larger and move more slowly Some proteins movie in a directed manner, others can be held in place As temperature decreases, phospholipids become closely packed and the membrane solidifies: Unsaturated hydrocarbon tails cannot pack as closely as saturated tails, membrane remains fluid to a lower temperature Cholesterol helps membranes resist changes in fluidity: Restrains phospholipid movement at high temperatures Hinders close packing at low temperatures Evolutionary differences in membrane lipid composition maintain appropriate fluidity under specific environmental conditions 3.1.0.2 Proteins determine membrane function: Figure 3.1: Proteins Integral proteins: penetrate the hydrophobic hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer Transmembrane proteins span the membrane, others extend only partway Some proteins have hydrophilic channels that allow passage of substances (a) Peripheral proteins: not embedded in the lipid bilayer. Loosely bound to the surface of the membrane, often to exposed parts of integral proteins Some membrane proteins are attached to the cytoskeleton or to fibers of the ECM, providing a strong framework for animal cells (c) A single cell may have proteins carrying out several functions, and a single protein may have multiple functions 3.1.0.3 Membrane carbohydrates and cell-cell recognition: Cells recognize other cells by binding to molecules, often containing carbohydrates, on the surface of the plasma membrane (d) Membrane carbohydrates are usually short and branched: Glycolipids: covalently bonded to lipids Glycoproteins: covalently bonded to proteins Function as markers that distinguish one cell from another 3.1.0.4 Synthesis and sidedness of membranes: A membrane has two distinct faces Asymmetric arrangement of proteins, lipids, and attached carbohydrates is determined as the membrane is being built Membrane proteins and lipids are synthesized in the ER Inside the Golgi apparatus, glycoproteins undergo carbohydrate modification, and some lipids become glycolipids Synthesized membrane components are transported by vesicles As vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, the outside face of the vesicle become continuous with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Carbohydrates are positioned on the extracellular face. 3.2 5.2 Membrane structure Selective permeability: allows some substances to cross it more easily than others "],
