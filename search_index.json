Bonds form and break quickly in liquid water. Four emergent properties arise 1.2.0.1 1. Cohesive behavior Hydrogen bonds keep water molecules close together (cohesion) Hydrogen bonds result in the clinging of water to other substances (adhesion) Cohesion gives water an unusually high surface tension 1.2.0.2 2. Moderation of temperature: Water absorbs heat from warm air and releases heat to cooler behavior Effective as a heat bank due to its high specific heat "]
