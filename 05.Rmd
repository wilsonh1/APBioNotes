# **5** Membrane Transport and Cell Signaling {#membrane}

- **Selective permeability:** allows some substances to cross it more easily than others

## **5.1** Cellular membranes

- Phospholipids:
    - Most abundant lipid in most membranes
    - **Amphipathic:** has both a hydrophilic region and a hydrophobic region. Bilayer arrangement shelters the hydrophobic tails while exposing the hydrophilic heads to water.

- Most membrane proteins are also amphipathic:
    - Can reside in the phospholipid bilayer with hydrophilic regions protruding
    - Provide its hydrophobic parts with a nonaqueous environment
