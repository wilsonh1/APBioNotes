# **5** Membrane Transport and Cell Signaling {#membrane}

## **5.1** Cellular membranes

```{r membrane, echo = FALSE, out.height = "300px"}

```

<div class = "flex">
<div class = "flex-text">
- Phospholipids:
    - Most abundant lipid in most membranes
    - **Amphipathic:** has both a hydrophilic region and a hydrophobic region. Bilayer arrangement shelters the hydrophobic tails while exposing the hydrophilic heads to water.
</div>
<div class = "flex-img">
```{r phospholipid, out.height = "180px", echo = FALSE}

```
</div>
</div>

- Most membrane proteins are also amphipathic:
    - Can reside in the phospholipid bilayer with hydrophilic regions protruding
    - Provides its hydrophobic parts with a nonaqueous environment
- **Fluid mosaic model:** the membrane is a mosaic of protein molecules bobbing in a fluid phospholipid bilayer

#### The fluidity of membranes:
- Most lipids and some proteins can shift about laterally:
    - Proteins are much larger and move more slowly
    - Some proteins movie in a directed manner, others can be held in place
- As temperature decreases, phospholipids become closely packed and the membrane solidifies:
    - Unsaturated hydrocarbon tails cannot pack as closely as saturated tails, membrane remains fluid to a lower temperature
    - Cholesterol helps membranes resist changes in fluidity:
        - Restrains phospholipid movement at high temperatures
        - Hinders close packing at low temperatures
- Evolutionary differences in membrane lipid composition maintain appropriate fluidity under specific environmental conditions

#### Proteins determine membrane function:

```{r membproteins, echo = FALSE, out.height = "350px", fig.cap = "Proteins"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/05/05_07_MembProteinFxns-L.jpg")
```

- **Integral proteins:** penetrate the hydrophobic hydrophobic interior of the lipid bilayer
    - Transmembrane proteins span the membrane, others extend only partway
    - Some proteins have hydrophilic channels that allow passage of substances ^[(a)](#fig:membproteins)^
- **Peripheral proteins:** not embedded in the lipid bilayer. Loosely bound to the surface of the membrane, often to exposed parts of integral proteins
- Some membrane proteins are attached to the cytoskeleton or to fibers of the ECM, providing a strong framework for animal cells ^[(c)](#fig:membproteins)^
- A single cell may have proteins carrying out several functions, and a single protein may have multiple functions

#### Membrane carbohydrates and cell-cell recognition:
- Cells recognize other cells by binding to molecules, often containing carbohydrates, on the surface of the plasma membrane ^[(d)](#fig:membproteins)^
- Membrane carbohydrates are usually short and branched:
    - **Glycolipids:** covalently bonded to lipids
    - **Glycoproteins:** covalently bonded to proteins
- Function as markers that distinguish one cell from another

#### Synthesis and sidedness of membranes:
- A membrane has two distinct faces
- Asymmetric arrangement of proteins, lipids, and attached carbohydrates is determined as the membrane is being built

```{r synthesis, echo = FALSE, out.height = "350px", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/05/05_08MembraneSynthesis-L.jpg")
```

1. Membrane proteins and lipids are synthesized in the ER
2. Inside the Golgi apparatus, glycoproteins undergo carbohydrate modification, and some lipids become glycolipids
3. Synthesized membrane components are transported by vesicles
4. As vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, the outside face of the vesicle become continuous with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Carbohydrates are positioned on the extracellular face.

## **5.2** Membrane structure
- **Selective permeability:** allows some substances to cross it more easily than others
